# IC‑AGI (Infrastructure Critical Anti‑AGI)

A distributed authority architecture designed to prevent intelligence from converting into unilateral control of critical systems.

## 🌍 Vision

We believe no single entity — human or artificial — should control critical infrastructure unilaterally.

IC‑AGI separates intelligence from authority.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- Threshold cryptography (K-of-N)
- Distributed execution
- Capability-based access control
- Immutable audit trails
- Governance-first security

## 🚀 Why Open Source?

Security through distribution.  
Authority through transparency.  
Resilience through collaboration.

Anyone can:

- Review the architecture
- Propose improvements
- Implement modules
- Run simulations
- Contribute research

## 🏗 Roadmap

1. MVP IR runtime
2. Capability system
3. Threshold authorization
4. Distributed simulation framework
5. Governance layer

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome:

- Cryptographers
- Distributed systems engineers
- Governance theorists
- Security researchers
- Systems architects

## 📜 License

Open source — permissive license recommended (e.g., Apache 2.0).

IC‑AGI is not a product.  
It is an architectural philosophy for the age of advanced intelligence.

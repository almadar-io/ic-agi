# PLAN-A v2 — IC-AGI

## Vision

Separate intelligence from authority.

IC-AGI ensures that no single entity — human or artificial — can unilaterally execute critical actions.

## Core Security Guarantees

- K-of-N Threshold Authorization
- Distributed Execution Model
- Capability-Based Access Control
- Append-Only Verifiable Audit
- Proactive Share Rotation

## Architecture

### Control Plane
- Deterministic Policy Engine
- Capability Issuer (TTL, Scope, Budget)
- Threshold Signers
- Immutable Audit Ledger

### Execution Plane
- Distributed IR Workers
- State Handoff Protocol
- Capability Verification

## Contributing

We welcome:

- Cryptographers
- Distributed Systems Engineers
- Governance Researchers
- Security Auditors
- Formal Methods Experts

## Development Phases

1. IR Specification
2. Threshold Crypto Integration
3. Distributed Execution Runtime
4. Governance Protocols
5. Anti-Oracle Detection

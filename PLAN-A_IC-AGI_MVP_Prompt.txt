IC‑AGI MVP CODE BASE

You are creating an MVP of a distributed secure execution system called
IC‑AGI (Infrastructure Critical Anti‑AGI).

Goals: 1) Accept an Intermediate Representation (IR) of a function. 2)
Split state into distributed shares. 3) Issue capability tokens (TTL,
scope, budget). 4) Require K-of-N threshold approval for critical
actions. 5) Log all actions in append-only audit storage.

Generate modules for: - IR definition - Share/unshare logic (mock) -
Worker execution stub - ControlPlane (capability issuance) - Threshold
authorization simulation - Append-only audit log - Scheduler for routing
IR segments

Language: Python

Requirements: - Use clear interfaces - Include comments explaining
security rationale - Separate ControlPlane and ExecutionPlane - Include
a simple test script demonstrating: - A trivial IR function (add two
numbers) - Distributed execution simulation - Capability validation -
Threshold approval simulation

Do NOT include production cryptography. Use stubs with comments where
real MPC/threshold crypto would be implemented.

Return only code modules and the test script.

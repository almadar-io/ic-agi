# ── IC-AGI Network Policy ──
# SECURITY: Restrict network access within the ic-agi namespace.
#
# Rules:
# - Workers can ONLY talk to the Control Plane (not to each other).
# - Control Plane can talk to Workers.
# - External ingress only reaches the Control Plane via the API service.
# - No egress to the internet from workers.
